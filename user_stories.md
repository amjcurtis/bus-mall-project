# User Stories for BusMall Lab Project

## User Stories: Marketing Research Role

As a contributor to market research in this area, I want:

1. To present the product choices in a pleasing, intuitive interface so that focus group participants can concentrate and provide accurate, useful market research data with minimal distraction.
2. To provide unique, non-repeating product choices to make the most of the 25 choices that focus group participants have.
3. To track the relative and absolute popularity of each product so the goals of our research are achieved.
4. To craft user stories that reflect the goals of our study for all three roles: market researcher, developer, and focus group participant.

## User Stories: Developer Role

As a developer working on the BusMall project, I want:

1. To structure my files and code in an orderly, intuitive way so that it will be clear what my development objectives are and how those objectives are achieved.
2. To break down my objectives into their smallest constituent problems so I can solve them systematically, piece by piece.
3. To test my code incrementally as I write it in small modules so I can ensure both that my programming work corresponds to my business requirements and that code works.
4. Commit my work to my daily Git branch at regular, logical intervals to track my progress and back up my work.

## User Stories: Focus Group Participant Role

As a participant in the BusMall market research focus group, I want:

1. To work with a pleasing interface that presents me with logical choices.
2. To see my contribution reflected in accurate study data that captures the relevant data points targeted by the study (absolute and relative popularity of each product I have to choose from).
3. To have randomly generated choices that give me a representative sampling of products to select from.
4. To have the study end when and how it is supposed to finish so that my time and effort is used well and not wasted.
